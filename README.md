Table Minion
============

Table Minion is the latest in a long line of computer thingies to automate the
selection of roleplaying tables for ICON. Hopefully, it will eventually handle
scoring and history tracking as well.

Usage
-----

At present, you kind of need to read the code to get it to do anything. That
will change once enough of the base functionality is in that it's worth
building some UI stuff on top of it.

Dependencies
------------

`pip install Flask`
